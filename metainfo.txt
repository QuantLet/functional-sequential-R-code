Published in: Streaming Curves, Structural Shifts: Tuning-Lean Online Monitoring via Self-Normalization

Description: R code accompanying the manuscript "Streaming Curves, Structural Shifts: Tuning-Lean Online Monitoring via Self-Normalization". Implements tuning-free online change-point monitoring for functional time series using adjusted-range self-normalization (RSMS), Shao-type self-normalization (SSMS), and a CUSUM-style benchmark (CSMS). The repository provides Monte Carlo critical values, simulation studies (size and power under multiple DGPs), and empirical illustrations for S&P 500 (SPX) data (SPX.csv not included).
